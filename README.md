### Enhanced RDP for Efficient Time Series Data Simplification
The Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm is renowned for simplifying lines and curves while preserving their essential characteristics. However, its efficiency dwindles with larger datasets, such as time series data, laden with redundant points.

Our research introduces the Enhanced RDP (ERDP) algorithm. ERDP leverages parallel computing and dynamic epsilon values tailored to dataset characteristics. This innovation reduces processing time and successfully eliminates up to 96.88% of redundant data points while maintaining accuracy.

ERDP forms the core of our Enhanced-RDP website, offering users a powerful tool for efficient time series data simplification.

## üåü How to Use

Follow these simple steps to utilize our tool effectively:

### Step 1 - Download Data From the Table
- Scroll down to the table in the home page, you'll find a selection of CSV files available for download.
- Click on the download link for the CSV file you want to process.
- Alternatively, you can upload your own CSV file as long as it follows this [format](#csv-format-rules).

### CSV Format Rules
If you plan to use your own time-series data in the system, be sure to read this. To ensure successful processing of your time series data, please adhere to the following format rules when preparing your CSV file:
#### 1. Two Columns Required
- Your CSV file must consist of exactly two columns.
- The first column should be reserved for labels or headers.
- The second column should contain the numerical values of the time series.


#### 2. Numerical Values
- The values column (second column) should contain only numerical data.
- Ensure that the data in the second column consists of numbers (integers or floating-point) suitable for time series analysis.

  
#### 3. Header in the First Row

- The first row of your CSV file should contain the labels or headers for the two columns.
- The labels should clearly describe the data in the corresponding columns, with the first label for the first column and the second label for the second column.
